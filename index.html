            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/mydogs.jpg" class="image" alt="My lovely pets">

            <p>I have two dachshunds, Dante and Kiro. They are so demanding and high-maintenance dogs. They wake me up before 6 o'clock in the morning for their morning walk and breakfast. I may not need an alarm set... They demand 20 minute-play time twice a day and three meals per day. Dante is dominant and smart. If I do not feed them three times he keeps barking or whining until he gets the three meals. Does he remember how many meals he got,I wonder. They think they are the owner and I am their butler or something. Although they are so demanding they are my lovely family! Anyhow, that's about my little pets. </p><br>
            <p>A little about me, I love travel. I am passionate about seeing different archtects, natures and cultures while traveling. I am a coffee lover as well as a dog lover. I usually drink coffee 5 cups or more a day. Especially I love espresso. Sometimes I have trouble with getting a sleep but still I cannot live without coffee.
